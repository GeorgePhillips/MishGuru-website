Snap Tags - a little known feature released in the new Snapchat™ update has got our team quite excited...

One of the biggest challenges brands face when establishing themselves on Snapchat™ is discovery. Overcoming the apathy required to have a follower manually enter a (correct) username is often surprisingly difficult.

Lets face it, us millennials are lazy. As interested as we might be in something, if it's going to take any kind of effort we'll think twice about it.

Snap Tags are a low friction, fail safe mechanism for discovering accounts. The distinctive images are easily recognised and can be built right into marketing materials.

Now, back to focusing on creating interesting content.
